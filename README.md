# catch_the_clown
Catch the clown, made with GameMaker for Mac OS X

This game was made with Lite version of GameMaker for Mac

Download **GameMaker for Mac v7.5.83** from [YoYo Games Legacy](https://www.yoyogames.com/legacy)

In [YoYo Games Sandbox, we can find resources](http://sandbox.yoyogames.com/make/resources) such as sprites, sounds and tutorials.
The first tutorial is **Tutorial: First Game**, the example it includes is the game **Catch the Clown** in **gmk** format/extension, but that file can't be opened with the legacy version of GameMaker for Mac. So here we have rewritten this example.
